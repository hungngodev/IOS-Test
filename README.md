## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
	•	Setting up and navigating Xcode feels quite different from using VS Code.
	•	The storyboard interface can be overwhelming with numerous buttons and adjustment options.
	•	Changes don’t immediately reflect on the iPhone simulator, requiring manual intervention.
 
Some ideas to improve the app are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background. I change the title and fontsize, background color of all three labels

App Idea: Flutter-Based Food Social Media App

The idea is to build a food-focused social media app where users can share home-cooked meals, restaurant experiences, and cooking tips. The app will integrate live video chat, allowing users to connect with friends while cooking in real time. It will also support peer-to-peer networking for seamless communication, API caching for quick content loading, and Redis-based workload distribution to ensure smooth performance. Additionally, it will feature Instacart automation to help users instantly purchase ingredients for recipes they discover. The goal is to create a highly interactive and scalable platform that enhances food-related social experiences while maintaining efficiency and low-latency performance.
